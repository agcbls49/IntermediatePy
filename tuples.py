# Tuple: Ordered, Immutable and allows Duplicate Elements
# As long as there is a comma then it will be recogniozed as a tuple
# Parethesis on both sides can also be added for easy distinction
# mytuple = "Max", "28", "Boston"
# print(mytuple)

# Built in tuple function can also be used
mytuple = tuple(["Max", "28", "Boston"])
# print(mytuple)

# Access elements inside a tuple
